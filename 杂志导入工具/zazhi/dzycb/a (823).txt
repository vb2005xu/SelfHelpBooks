　　今天就放其中的两首给大家听。音乐播放器在博客页面左下方，呵呵，开始享受吧！

 

　　好音乐，好心情。

 

　　周末愉快！



 

《in the deep》

 

thought you had 
all the answers to rest your heart upon. 
but something happens don't see it coming

now you can't stop yourself. 
now you're out there swimming 
in the deep. 
in the deep. 

Life keeps tumbling your heart in circles 
till you... let go 
till you shed your pride and you climb to heaven 
and you throw yourself off. 
now you're out there spinning 
in the deep. 
in the deep. 
in the deep. 
in the deep. 

and now you're out there spinning 
and now you're out there spinning 
in the deep. 
in the deep. 
in the deep. 
in the deep.
If you want everything, let everything go

 

 

《maybe tomorrow》

 

I've been down and I m wondering why
These little black clouds keep walking around with me

with me Waste time and I d rather be high
Think I ll walk me outside and buy a rainbow smile but be free

be all free
So maybe tomorrow I ll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow I ll find my way home

I look around at a beautifiul life
I been the upper side of down
been the inside of out but we breathe, we breathe

I wanna a breeze in an open mind
I wanna swim in the ocean
wanna take my time for me

all free

So maybe tomorrow I ll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow I ll find my way home

So maybe tomorrow I ll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow I ll find my way home
