When you
are old


叶芝


When you are old
and grey and full of sleep.


And nodding by the
fire, take down this book.


And slowly read,
and dream of the soft look


Your eyes had once,
and of their shadows deep.


How many loved your
moments of glad grace.


And loved your
beauty with love false or true.


But one man loved
the pilgrim soul in you.


And loved the
sorrows of your changing face;


And bending down
beside the glowing bars,


Murmur, a little
sadly, how Love fled


And paced upon the
mountains overhead


And hid his face
amid a crowd of stars.

 

当你老了

冰心 译


 
 
当你老了，头发花白，睡意沉沉， 


倦坐在炉边，取下这本书来，


慢慢读着，追梦当年的眼神 


那柔美的神采与深幽的晕影。

 


多少人爱过你青春的片影， 


爱过你的美貌，以虚伪或是真情， 


惟独一人爱你那朝圣者的灵魂， 


爱你哀戚的脸上岁月的留痕。 


 


在炉栅边，你弯下了腰， 


低语着，带着浅浅的伤感， 


爱情是怎样逝去，又怎样步上群山， 


怎样在繁星之间藏住了脸。
